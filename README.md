# BairesDev NodeJS Coding Challenge
In this project, I aim to demonstrate my expertise in Node.js. I have been using it for a while now, and it's the technology I feel most comfortable with.

## Getting Started
To get started, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have Node.js installed, you can start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/VictorMrojas/NodeJS-Challenge.git
```
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory by running the following command:
```
cd NodeJSTest
```
Now, you can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary packages and dependencies required for the project to run.

## Running the Project
To run the project, you can use the following command:
```
npm start
```
This will start the server and make it available on http://localhost:3000.
